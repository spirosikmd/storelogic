storelogic
==========

A simple client to the [Paylogic API](https://doc.sandbox.paylogic.com/).

Built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/),
and [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Run

```npm install``` and ```bower install```

to install the required node modules and bower components. Finally, run

```grunt server```

to compile the CoffeeScript files and run a development server. That is enough.
Though this will not work for the public. At the moment, Paylogic API does not
provide native support for JavaScript clients, and authentication cannot be
established.
