storelogic
==========

A simple client to the [Paylogic API](https://doc.sandbox.paylogic.com/).

Built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/),
and [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

```grunt server```

will compile the CoffeeScript files and run a development server. That is enough.
Though this will not work for the public. At the moment, Paylogic API does not
provide native support for JavaScript clients.
